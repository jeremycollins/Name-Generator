Name Generator Script

Generates a random list of strings based off of user input. The user can choose either a vowel, consonant, or any letter for each character in the string. The script will randomly pull letters from a list of vowels, consonants, or randomly pick from both and generate 10 different strings for you. 

This script currently only generates 3 character strings.
